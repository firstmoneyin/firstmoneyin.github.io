                In certain circumstances we may share your Personal Information with third parties without further
                notice to you, unless required by the law, as set forth below:

                reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of all or a portion of our assets, or transition of
                service to another provider (collectively a “Transaction”), your Personal Information and other
                information may be shared in the diligence process with counterparties and others assisting with the
                Transaction and transferred to a successor or affiliate as part of that Transaction along with other

            </p>
            <p>

                Legal Requirements: If required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is
                necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, including to meet national security or law enforcement
                requirements, (ii) protect and defend our rights or property, (iii) prevent fraud, (iv) act in urgent
                circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services, or the public, or (v) protect
                against legal liability.

            <p>
                Affiliates: We may share Personal Information with our affiliates, meaning an entity that controls, is
                controlled by, or is under common control with FirstMoney.In. Our affiliates may use the Personal
                Information we share in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Other Users: certain actions you take may be visible to other users of the Service. For example, in
                the future, it likely will be possible for FirstMoney.In users to create profile pages, and these will
                be published on the Internet.
